[RRTM](http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html) is a radiation code that is widely used in atmospheric science. The code has a rather nasty ascii interface that is a big obstacle to using the code in scripts, and also inhibits performance if lots of radiative transfer calculations need doing. pyrrtm aims to address these issues, allowing RRTM to work well alongside python.
